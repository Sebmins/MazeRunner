# MazeRunner

After University I used my maze generation skills to develop an infinite runner for mobile. From primarily learning Java at University I wanted to challenge myself by learning C# in Unity.

I developed a procedural generation algorithm that allows me to generate many different levels of varying difficulty. The image below shows the constraints that can be applied on the algorithm. When playing the game in the level select there is a “custom” option that allows the player to edit these values and create their own level.
